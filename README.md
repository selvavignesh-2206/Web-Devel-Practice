# Web Development Practice

## INFO

This is repo contains the various code files for my pactice web development course. I was following the Udemy course called "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022" by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

6) Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.
7) AJAX and single page apps
8) Bootstrap 4 and 5 (alpha)
9) SemanticUI
10) Bulma CSS Framework
11) DOM Manipulation
12) Unix(Command Line) Commands
13) NodeJS
14) NPM
15)ExpressJS
16) Templating
17) REST
18) SQL vs. NoSQL databases
19) MongoDB
20) Database Associations
21) Schema Design
22) Mongoose
23) Authentication From Scratch
24) Cookies & Sessions
25) Authorization
26) Common Security Issues - SQL Injection, XSS, etc.
